"hi everyone and welcome to apnea college and in this video we are going to download vs code for windows and for mac so vs code is a really popular editor by microsoft which is used to write code in different languages which includes c c plus java python and we can also build huge projects with technologies like node.js and django so let's start with the installation for a windows system in windows system we are going to go to our browser which is chrome and inside chrome we're going to search for visual studio code so now we have to go to this first link that appears in our browser which does not have any add tag to it so if there is an ad tag we have to skip that link let's directly go to the code.visualstudio.com link and here we can see a huge download button which is used to download visual studio code so now we have all of the options for different machines since we are working on the windows machine we are going to download vs code for a windows machine and we click on the download button and the download starts automatically so it will take about two minutes for vs code to download now once vs code is completely downloaded let us double click on it and open it so this window appears to us which is to set up visual studio code and we are going to accept the agreement that microsoft has for us we are going to click on this next button and we will keep the settings to default and click on the next button again click next again and if we want to create a desktop icon that is if we want to access visual studio code from our desktop from next time then we can tick on this check box and then we have to go to next and finally install so right now visual studio code is getting installed in our machine after downloading and once all of the files are extracted we can finish the process and this vs code window appears for us this appears because we have finally downloaded vs code so it has a theme option and i'm going to go with the dark theme we are going to do mark done because we don't want to change any of the default settings right now and now we can open a new file and we can start writing our code so this was a short tutorial on how

seconds and now we have to double click on it and it will start expanding the zip folder so i can see that visual studio code is here and if i double click on visual studio code it will open for me so it has automatically downloaded and installed itself since i'm opening this app for the first time so i will have to click on open but when you open vs code for the next time you won't have to click
